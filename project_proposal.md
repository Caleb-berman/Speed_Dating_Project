### Question
We hope to analyze the dating data set to answer the questions below:

To what degree does physical attractiveness affect the success of a speed dating pairing?
Are other factors significant in predicting pairing success?
Can we build a model to predict partners with some success?

### Dataset

We have an initial dataset collected from a Columbia University speed dating study.

Our dataset includes data on the attractiveness ratings of individuals by every person they speed dated with. In addition, it includes information on each individual’s background and interests. By averaging over the attractiveness and interests of each person, we can identify why certain pairings match and others not.

The dataset can be found on the following Kaggle page:

### Why is this important
Dating apps are becoming increasingly important in today’s society. The initial success of a pairing of two random people is dependent on a variety of factors. Our group will determine the degree to which attractiveness plays a role in the initial interest between two people who have had conversation. We believe this study done by Columbia University can mimic the quick potential partner decisions made by users in popular dating applications used today, especially given the lack of publicly available data from these companies.
