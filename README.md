# Speed Dating Analysis

Members: Jack Beautz (jpb375) and Caleb Berman (ckb65)

We will be working with the following speed dating Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment. It contains data about the participants, their backgrounds, their interests and attractiveness. The goal of the project is to predict if participants want to see other participants again based on physical attractiveness as opposed to other possible indicators.

Our completed report can be found in both pdf and md form (labelled final_report).

All python code can be found in EBM and python exploration.ipynb 

All Julia code can be found in julia_data.ipynb

Hope you enjoy!
