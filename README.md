We will be working with the following speed dating Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment. It contains data about the participants, their backgrounds, their interests and attractiveness. The goal of the project is to predict if participants want to see other participants again based on physical attractiveness as opposed to other possible indicators.
